10/10

- 3 flops, 3 loads, 1 store = 3/(8*4) = 3/32 flops/byte
- 2 flops, 1 load = 1/4 flops/byte (`s` is scalar in register)
- 2 flops, 2 loads = 1/8 flops/byte
- 2 flops, 2 loads, 1 store = 2/(8*3) = 1/12 flops/byte ('C' is scalar in register)
Couple minor errors in your math - but it's the right work

Good job!
